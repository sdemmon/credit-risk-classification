# credit-risk-classification


In this project, I conducted an analysis of credit risk classification using machine learning methods. I started by preprocessing the data, dividing it into training and testing sets. Then, I built and evaluated a logistic regression model, examining its performance through metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Furthermore, I prepared a straightforward credit risk analysis report summarizing the model's findings and suggesting potential applications. This project improved my skills in data analysis and model development and helped me communicate insights clearly through written reports.
